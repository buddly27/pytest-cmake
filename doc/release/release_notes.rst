.. release:: Upcoming

    .. change:: changed

        Updated CMake script now interrupts the build if the Python test
        collection fails.

.. release:: 0.4.1
    :date: 2024-03-17

    .. change:: fixed

        As of Hatching v1.22, dynamic dependencies during build time must
        be imported lazily. Therefore, the backend script has been updated
        to import 'pytest' only when the build hook is called.
